### üõ† Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** SpringBoot
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Cloud Storage:** AWS S3
- **AI Integration:** LLM - Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct

### üîß Setup Instructions
To get the project up and running locally, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites**
- Node.js and npm for the React frontend
- JDK 23 for the backend
- MongoDB for the database

**Clone the Repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/vanshika5605/travel-planner.git
cd travel-planner
```
**Setting Up the Backend (SprintBoot)** 
Navigate to the backend directory:
```
cd backend
```
Now, navigate to IntelliJ and start the backend from TravelPlannerApplication class. Optionally, start the project from command line:
```
cd /travel-planner //Navigate to the Project Directory
mvn clean install //Clean and Build the Project
mvn spring-boot:run //Run the Application
java -jar //target/travel-planner
```

**Setting Up the Backend (Flask)** 
Navigate to the ai-recommender-new directory:
```
cd ai-recommender-new
```
Install the Python dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Start the Flask server(By default runs the app on port 5000): 
```
flask run
```
On MacOs, port 5000 is occupied with some other process. So run the backend on MacOs on a port other than 5000. Use the following command to run the backend on port 5050:
```
flask run --port 5050
```
if the flask commmand does not work on local terminal, create a python virtual environment and download and run flask application:
```
python3 -m venv path/to/venv
source path/to/venv/bin/activate
pip3 install flask
flask run --port 5050
```

**Setting Up the Frontend (React)**
Navigate to the frontend directory:
```
cd frontend
```
**Install the npm dependencies:**
```
npm install
```
**Start the React development server:**
```
npm start
```

**Set Environment Variables**
Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following variables:
```
FLASK_ENV=development
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY='<your-token>'
MONGODB_URI=your_database_url
DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name
```
**Access the Application**
Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the frontend.
