- Integrated the Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model using the Hugging Face Inference API to power itinerary generation and packing lists.
- Conducted research on user needs, travel trends, and AI applications for itinerary and packing assistance. Optimized and tested AI outputs to ensure alignment with user expectations, including improving prompt designs for better results.
- Implemented AI-powered features for generating personalized itineraries based on user inputs (destination, duration, mood, etc.).
- Designed the Smart Packing Assistant to create tailored packing lists based on destination, activities, and weather.
- Worked on the "ai-recommender-new" project, where she set up the Flask API from scratch, ensuring it followed a modular structure. Created three APIs:
  1. Two variants for the itinerary creation API (`http://127.0.0.1:5050/api/v1/itinerary/create`):
     - One variant requires only a message from the user to generate the itinerary (e.g., "I want to plan a trip by the water for about 3 days near Goa India, my budget is 900 USD").
     - The second variant requires detailed information, including travel type, budget, start and end dates, and a note (e.g., "travel_type": "Business", "budget": 500, "start_date": "2025-01-07", "end_date": "2025-01-09", "note": "My trip to Madrid is important because I want to explore the culture and cuisine").
  2. Created another API (`http://localhost:5050/api/v1/packingList/create`) for generating packing lists for any saved itinerary.
- Optimized and tested AI outputs to ensure alignment with user expectations, including improving prompt designs for better results.
